summary: 'Welcome to my new tech blog.'

As of today, memory dump goes live. This site is intended as a blog with short articles mainly about software architecture, software engineering and technology in general.

I am excited to see it grow throughout the coming months and eventually become somewhat of a knowledge database. At this point, I also expect some large changes still to come regarding its appearance, navigation, etc. Just bear with me :)
